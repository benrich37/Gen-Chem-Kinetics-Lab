# Purpose
This repo is meant to host materials for a computational lab aimed at undergraduates without any coding experience who are taking General Chemistry. The purpose of this lab is to use exploration of the concept of chemical kinetics as a vehicle for students to improve computer literacy as well as mathematical intuition. The procedure of this lab includes the execution of simple python scripts organized into a jupyter notebook. While no coding is done, the code itself is written to prioritize readability, encouraging students to read through it and digest what each block of code does.
The procedure also generates a relatively large csv file, which the student is instructed to analyze with Excel. It is reccomended that the time step for the simulation to be kept very small, so students must learn how to import text files into Excel instead of transcribing data by hand, and so students must use built-in shortcuts to perform any of the needed actions on the data.
